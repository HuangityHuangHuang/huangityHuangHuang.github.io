		<h3 id="H01">A Brief History of Toast</h3>
		<p>
		<!-- history below -->
		&ldquo;Toast&rdquo; originates from the word &ldquo;torrere&rdquo; in Latin, which means &ldquo;to burn.&rdquo;
		Dated back to the medieval times, toasting was a way of preserving
		bread. In the <b>1400s</b>, toast used to be used as flavouring in drinks, rather than food for people to eat.
		Beginning in the <b>1850s</b>, people began to know toast as a part of American cuisine, and ever since then, toast has become a regular portion of
		people&#39;s daily meals, especially breakfasts.
		<br>
		The first &ldquo;pop&#45;up&rdquo; toaster was called the Toastmaster and was made in <b>1926</b>.
